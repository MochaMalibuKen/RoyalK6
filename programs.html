        <h3>Community Service Projects</h3>
        <p>
          Youth participate in service opportunities such as clean-up events, volunteering at shelters, tutoring, and health awareness efforts. 
          These projects teach empathy, responsibility, and leadership while strengthening neighborhoods.
