        <h1 class="section-title">The heart behind Royal K6.</h1>
        <p class="section-subtitle">
          Royal K6 Motivational Group was born out of a desire to see young people know who they are, Whose they are,
          and what they’re capable of. Roy and Kenya Washington began this work by simply loving on kids in their own
          community — and it grew into a movement.

      <p style="font-size: 0.96rem; color: #374151; max-width: 720px;">
        Today, Royal K6 serves youth and families through mentoring, spiritual encouragement, and practical support.
        We focus on building character, resilience, and hope, one relationship at a time. Our goal is not just to “run
        programs,” but to walk with kids through real life — pointing them to purpose, faith, and a community that
        refuses to give up on them.
