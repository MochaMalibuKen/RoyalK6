            <p>
                Royal’K6 Youth In Action was founded by <strong>Kenya N. Washington</strong> and her husband 
                <strong>Roy Washington</strong>, leaders rooted deeply in service, faith, and the belief that 
                today’s youth are tomorrow’s change-makers. Their work grew from years of grassroots mentoring, 
                community service, support for young people in difficult situations, and a powerful vision:  
                <em>to make every young person feel seen, supported, prepared, and uplifted.</em>
            </p>

            <p>
                Their mission caught the attention of the community and local media, including being featured 
                in the <strong>WACH Carolina Champion</strong> spotlight. Today, Royal’K6 is a 
                <strong>501(c)(3) nonprofit (Tax ID: 87-0866832)</strong> focused on mentorship, skill building, 
                leadership development, life readiness, and positive community impact.

            <h2 class="section-title">Why We Serve</h2>
            <p>
                Royal’K6 was built from a shared belief that every child—no matter their background—deserves 
                support, guidance, opportunity, and unconditional belief in their worth. Through mentorship, 
                skill development, structured activities, and community service, we strive to break cycles, 
                build confidence, and create pathways toward a brighter future.
            </p>

            <p>
                We stand for hope. For safety. For emotional and spiritual growth.  
                For discipline, respect, commitment, and love.  
                <strong>Because when youth feel empowered, entire communities rise.</strong>
